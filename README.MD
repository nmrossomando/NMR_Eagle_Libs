NMR Eagle Libs
==============

Well, along with code, I do some electronics design for personal projects.
I use Cadsoft Eagle (recently bought by Autodesk) for these designs, and I 
have custom libraries for many of my common parts. Problem: I do design on 
at least 2 different computers, and thus the libraries became a jumbled 
mess! 

This is my solution: I'm starting my libraries over, using the git to keep 
them in sync. Hopefully this works a bit better!
